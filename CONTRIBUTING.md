# Contributing to Jq

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

New tests for failing functions are our current highest priority. 
A PR such as this one adding MinOpTests based on the open source code documentation are most welcome and most useful to us right now:
https://github.com/timestored/jq/pull/5/files

If you wish to get more engaged or engage in a different way please get in touch or raise an issue.
